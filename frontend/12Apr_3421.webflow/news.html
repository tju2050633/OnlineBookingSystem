          <p class="testimonial-text-three">Watching former USA teammates compete on same stage as men at the Sevens was ‘cool’, Gustaitis says.<br>Olympic inclusion has put ‘huge focus’ on growing sevens in United States, with 2028 LA Games a major draw for teenage girls, she adds.</p><img src="images/New1.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, 691px" srcset="images/New1-p-500.png 500w, images/New1.png 691w" alt="">

      <p class="paragraph-9">Former USA captain Abby Gustaitis said rugby empowers women to a degree “unmatched in other sports” after she marvelled at the latest evidence of it at the Cathay/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens.<br>‍<br>Attending as an HSBC ambassador, Gustaitis praised the city’s showpiece event for its part in promoting equality by including a full women’s world series event for a second year running.<br>‍<br>The 32-year-old, who co-captained her country’s sevens team to the quarter-finals of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and was a 2017 Rugby World Cup semi-finalist, contrasts that equal treatment with her experiences elsewhere. She was a high-school basketball star before joining the United States’ national rugby programme in 2015.<br><br>“Having the same size pitch, and the same rules as the men, along with the feeling of complete parity, drew me to rugby,” Gustaitis said.</p><img src="images/New1-2.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, 690px" srcset="images/New1-2-p-500.png 500w, images/New1-2.png 690w" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-9">“I grew up playing basketball, and the three-point line for women was closer than in the men’s game. It was so frustrating, I always felt, ‘Do [administrators] not think I am capable?’“<br><br>I came into rugby and immediately appreciated the full-contact aspect of the sport, and the ability to take ownership of what we were doing. It felt like, ‘Anything [men] can do, I can do, too.’”<br><br>Men’s and women’s competitions coexist in the elite HSBC SVNS Series, and in the second-rung Challenger Series in which Hong Kong compete.<br><br>“It was so cool to see my former teammates running out onto the pitch in Hong Kong, and the crowd equally excited for the men’s and women’s games,” Gustaitis said. “There was no sense of, ‘The women are playing, let’s take a break.’ All eyes are continuously on the pitch.”<br></p>

      <p class="paragraph-9">Brazil’s performances at the Cathay/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens were nothing if not underwhelming, but any time on the pitch for Raquel Kochhann was a blessing.<br><br>The 31-year-old only returned to the sport in January, after spending almost two years fighting and beating breast cancer.<br><br>While Brazil’s 14-5 loss to Great Britain in the ninth place play-off left them further adrift of the safety of the top eight, Kochhann said every game “was an inspiration, not just in life but for everything”.<br><br>“Rugby needs all of you, you need to be strong, fast and have good energy, so for me to be here, it’s such a big thing not just because of the cancer, but because I’m able to be a rugby player,” she said.<br><br>The two-time Olympian pulled on the gold jersey for the first time in 20 months in January, when Brazil went to Perth for the third leg of the HSBC SVSN Series.<br></p><img src="images/New2-2.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, 694px" srcset="images/New2-2-p-500.png 500w, images/New2-2.png 694w" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-9">She had not appeared for her country since May 2022, when she suffered a knee injury during a 31-7 defeat to England. It was during her recovery she was diagnosed with cancer.<br>‍<br>Kochhann said before the Perth tournament she was “stronger, faster and more motivation” despite spending the previous year in hospital waiting rooms and treatment centres.<br><br>But during the invasive treatment process, Kochhann was still training with the squad and after Sunday’s game at Hong Kong Stadium, praised her teammates.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-9">James Sawyer is confident of thriving amid the fanfare of the Cathay/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens, after surviving a “brutal” transition from the 15s code to earn his tournament debut.<br><br>Sawyer’s first experience of the event came in 2017, around six months after moving to Hong Kong, when he “was floating around the South Stand, dressed as a Viking”.<br><br>His parents will have the bonus of seeing their son in action when they join the party this year, after booking to travel from the UK before Christmas, when Sawyer was not filled with confidence he would be involved.<br><br>The 30-year-old, who has played rugby 15s for Hong Kong, “jumped at the opportunity” to cross over to sevens, and remain on a full-time basis after the 15-a-side national set-up was axed in 2021 because of the financial stress applied by Covid.<br><br>“I feel like I am starting to find my feet,” Sawyer said.<br><br>“Sevens is a completely different sport, with very different cardiovascular demands. Initially, I was catching my breath at every break in play, but I am more consistent now. I think the coach [Jevon Groves] would say I am only just feeling comfortable.<br></p><img src="images/New3-2.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, 694px" srcset="images/New3-2-p-500.png 500w, images/New3-2.png 694w" alt="">

      <p class="paragraph-9">“I never questioned my decision to cross over, but at times in the first six months we were training in 36-degree heat, and it was pretty brutal. You have to switch your mindset to look forward to those sessions, as much as they are going to hurt.</p>
